# # CANARIE 2017 -- Analysis of the survey

# This notebook is the first draft to analyse the results from [CANARIE]()

# ## Preparation and filtering of the dataset

# In[1]:

# Load libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib

# When using Ipython within vim
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')

# When using within jupyter
# get_ipython().magic('matplotlib inline')  # Activat that line to use in Jupyter

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#  When using this script with ipython and vimss
plt.ion()
plt.show()


# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('./dataset/2017 Cdn Research Software Developer Survey - Public data.csv')
# Number of row == number of participants
len(df.index)

# Replacing all the answer "Prefer not to answer" by NaN, as they are not useful in the analysis
df.replace('Prefer not to answer', np.NaN, inplace=True)


# ### Date submitted
# The variable 'Date submitted' is set up when the participant finish the survey. If the row on this column is empty, it means the participant did not finish the survey. These participants are removed, even if they have submitted partial answers.

# In[3]:

# df['Date submitted'].unique
df = df[df['Date submitted'].notnull()]
# Getting the number of row from the reduced dataframe
len(df.index)


# ### Countries
# A question asked the participants in which country they were currently working and specify when it was not Canada.
#


pd.crosstab(df['In which country do you work?'], columns='Countries')


# There is only 4 others. Which are only one from Japan, 2 from USA and one from UK.


pd.crosstab(df['In which country do you work? [Other]'], columns='Other countries')


# As this answer are not useful for CANARIE, because these people are not working in Canada, they are removed from the dataset.


df = df.loc[df['In which country do you work?'] != 'Other']
# Getting the number of row from the reduced dataframe
len(df.index)


# ### Writing software as part of the work
#
# One question asked if the participants write software for research as part of their work.


pd.crosstab(df['Do you write software for research as part of your job?'], columns='Writing software')


# 13 answered 'No'. This survey, being about researcher that write codes, they are removed from the dataset


df = df.loc[df['Do you write software for research as part of your job?'] == 'Yes']
# Getting the number of row from the reduced dataframe

# ### Languages
#
# The survey was in French and in English. The option choose by the participant was collected. It is possible then to see the proportion of participants that answered the survey in French or in English
